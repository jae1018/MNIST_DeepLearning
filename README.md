# MNIST_DeepLearning

This program uses Deep Learning to perform digit detection on hand-drawn images of numbers. The data set and its reader were imported from 3rd party MIT-licensed software located at https://github.com/wichtounet/mnist.

Neural Network Implementation:
5 K-connected layers are used (K-connected means each node in layer i is connected to every node in layer i + 1)
